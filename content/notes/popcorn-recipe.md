This is a great recipe for making homemade popcorn that tastes like movie theater popcorn. I honed this recipe back in 2021 after not being able to go to the movies for a year. I use a [WhirleyPop](https://www.whirleypopshop.com/), but any thin walled pot (wok, etc.) with a foil lid with a few vent holes will work. 


## Ingredients
- 1/3 cup popcorn kernels
- 1.5 tbsp ghee
- 1.5 tbsp coconut oil
- 1/2 tsp powdered salt

Note: butter CANNOT be substituted here, ghee has a much higher smoke point and less moisture content.
Note: powdered salt can be made with a spice grinder and some coarse sea salt.

## Steps
1. Combine both oils and powdered salt in a thin pan (or WhirleyPop) on medium heat. 
2. Add a few kernels of popcorn, after they pop, add the rest of the kernels.
3. Stir for ~2 minutes or until you hear around 1 second between pops.
4. Remove from heat while stirring with lid removed. 
5. Enjoy!
